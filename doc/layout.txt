There are the standard commands
	\chapter#1#2
	\section#1#2
	\subsection#1#2
where the first arg is some kind of
numbering thing, and the second arg
is supposed to be the title.

Automatic numbering is implemented.
For this, use the commands
	\nchapter#1
	\nsection#1
	\nsubsection#1

PROPOSAL: In the future, use some
global value
	\numberingON ???
to switch between the two with
one change. Then we can eliminate
the whole \n... buisness. Plus
the current math enviornments
require numbering, so this problem
can be fixed as well.
